# Haskell-tSNE #

A pure Haskell implementation of the [t-SNE](https://lvdmaaten.github.io/tsne/) data dimension reduction algorithm.

* The `tsne3D` function takes a list of high dimension values and generates a sequence of solutions. Each solution is a list of 3D points, one for each input value.
* Very, very slow (not at all optimized yet, or even profiled. Internally it uses lists of plain vanilla Haskell boxed `Double`s, which probably accounts for a a fair chunk of the slowness)
* Based on the [tSNEJS](https://github.com/karpathy/tsnejs) JavaScript implementation

### Example ###

Using the Python scikit-learn [digits](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_digits.html#sklearn.datasets.load_digits) data set.
```
#!haskell
